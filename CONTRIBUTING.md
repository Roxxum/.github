# Contributing to Roxxum
Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! Some ideas to get started are:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a bugfix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## All reports are tracked using github issues
There is templates setup for bugs and requests, and is the main method used for project tracking.

## All code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Click that pull request button!

## Use a consistent coding style
See the `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for specific guidelines on code style used by @Roxxum/core-devs.
For anything not specified, generally following accepted community standards is a good place to start.

## Make sure you understand the licenses used by Roxxum
By submitting a Pull Request, you are accepting the possibility that your code will be accepted and merged into this code base!
It will then become subject to the license terms used by the project. Never submit code to a project with a license that you don't agree with!
